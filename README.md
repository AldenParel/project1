My project is a cgi script that prints the input from an html file and the environmental variables. The html file asks the user to input his/her first name. I did not use the Mod rewrite rules because I wasn't sure what it was for. The public link for the cgi file is http://www.csun.edu/~ajp76434/cgi-bin/simple.cgi.
